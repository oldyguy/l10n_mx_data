c_Localidad.xlsx

($og 2019-07-08) Warning!

I decided to modify this file as it has "Ciudad de Mexico" as the name of
all 16 "alcaldías" (former "delegaciones").

That was a big issue for users as every invoice/note has to include the 
right locality number (01..16) in order for both originator & recipient's
addresses can be certified by the PAC/SAT (certification authorized 
provider/tax admin service in Mexico).

Several EDI solutions had to create their own fields in order to fulfill
this requirement, just because names are wrong and its numeric code are
the only thing that matters in the XML file.

To avoid versioning issues with the official SAT numbering, I decided to 
name it v1.01, as they use one decimal only.
